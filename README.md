Application tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS

Although I initially used FetchContent, it created too many difficulties for unit
testing that distracted me from creating the game. Hence, both Raylib 5.5 and Catch2 v3
are installed system-wide.

Requriements:
Raylib 5.5
CMake 3.31 or later
C++ C17
Catch2 v3
