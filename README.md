Created with CLion ( https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ )

<h3>Requirements:</h3>h3>
<ul>
<li>Git</li>
<li>Raylib 5.5 ( https://github.com/raysan5/raylib )</li>
<li>CMake 4.0 or later although tested with v3.31 without issues ( https://cmake.org/ )</li>

<h3>Thoughts</h3>
I have tried TDD. so far I have failed misserable to either use a framework (gtest, catch2) or manual testing.
Hence, the strange structure and content of the lists files. I had to really simplify some things when I tried 
to understand how to make it work. No success so far.
