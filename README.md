Application tested on Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS

Although I initially used FetchContent, and it worked, I have it now installed in my system.

I have tried for 1 week non-stop to integrate either a testing framework (gtest and catch2) or
manual "no-framework" testing. I failed miserably. I will continue with the project and tray again
once I recover emmotionally. ;)
